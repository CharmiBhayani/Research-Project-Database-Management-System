# Research-Project-Database-Management-System

## Overview
A centralized Research Project Database Management System designed to streamline project tracking, progress reporting, funding management, and publication linkage for academic institutions. The system supports multiple user roles and provides structured workflows for research administration.

## Key Features
- Role-Based Access Control (Student, Faculty, Admin, Sponsor)
- Project lifecycle management (Proposed → Active → On Hold → Completed → Archived)
- Weak entity modeling for project progress with faculty approval workflow
- Sponsor–funding–project relational linkage
- Document submission and structured reporting
- Student can connect to faculty based on specialialization 

## Database Design
- Noun analysis and ER modeling
- Normalization up to 3NF to remove redundancy and anomalies
- Relational schema with primary and foreign key constraints
- Data integrity checks and role-based data visibility
- Support for multi-user transactional workflows

## System Architecture
Users → Application Layer → Relational Database  
The database acts as the single source of truth for project, funding, and publication data.

## My Contribution
- Designed the complete ER diagram and performed normalization up to 3NF  
- Created the relational schema with constraints and weak entity relationships  
- Modeled role-based access control for different user types  
- Defined project lifecycle states and progress tracking workflow  
- Structured sponsor–funding linkage and reporting entities  
- Authored the Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
